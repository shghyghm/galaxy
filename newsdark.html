          <p>An eclipsing binary millisecond pulsar discovered by FAST</p>
        </div>

      <div class="box-c"><p>Led a research team
        Using data from the FAST Radio Telescope, Professor Pan Zichen and Professor Di Li of the National Astronomical Observatory at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) discovered a double millisecond pulsar in the M92 star cluster.
        
        Also known as the PSR J1717 + 4307A and M92A, it is the first pulsar identified in Messier 92. Its rotation period is 3.16 milliseconds.
        
        Follow-up of observations showed that this dual system is in a circular orbit with a rotation period of 0.2 days and a radius of 120,000 km.
        Its companion star is 0.18 times the mass of the Sun and is becoming a relatively massive star. Due to the compactness of the orbit, the material from the companion star is swallowed by the pulsar.
        
        Such a dual system has been called the "red-backed spider". This pulsar, like this type of spider, tends to accumulate material from its companion star.</p></div>

          <p>NASA researchers: Applicants for life on Mars must be genetically modified.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="box-c"><p>New research by scientists shows that if humans want to live on Mars or any other extraterrestrial environment for long periods of time, they must first genetically modify the genome and change some of its characteristics.

        Kenda Lynch, space expert and microbiologist: So far, NASA has used the drug to protect astronauts from physical hazards in space, but for a long-term presence on Mars, there is no choice but to make harmless genetic changes in humans; This method can even help humans to be in more unknown and more distant parts of space.</p></div>
